then inside the app

- main page and layout of the root project

- if you have 2 or more projects you need to rewrite the layout and main page by creating another main and layout page inside the created folder

then inside the project's folder
you have to create 4 directories

- 1 client side (create page and layout inside)
- 2 admin side (create page and layout inside)
- 3 lib folders or scripts
  inside lib folder contains all the important functions

why create another page.tsx and layout.tsx
- it is for rewriting the layout of the root project

both views folder should contain their own components
eg.Navbar
